<h1>Student Fact Template Builder Documentation</h1>
<p>This application uses ASP.NET Web API to allow a user to build sa Student Fact Template.</p>
<p>It also makes use of several frameworks and libraries including:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://get.asp.net/'>ASP.NET Core</a> and <a href='https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/67ef8sbd.aspx'>C#</a> for cross-platform server-side code</li>
  <li><a href='https://angular.io/'>Angular</a> and <a href='http://www.typescriptlang.org/'>TypeScript</a> for client-side code</li>
  <li><a href='http://getbootstrap.com/'>Bootstrap</a> for layout and styling</li>
  <li><a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/'>Entity Framework</a> for database interactions</li>
  <li><a href='https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/'>CSVHelper</a> for creating relevant csv files</li>
</ul>

<h2>SQL script</h2>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what was meant by "SQL deployment script", and also had difficulty testing the script I did make due to all the how sql connections and databases are already intigrated into my computer.</p>

<h2>Some general notes regarding this project:</h2>
<p>The project doc said to use ASP.NET, however, for some reason I could only find ASP.NET Core when setting up Visual Studios. I'm assuming the difference is marginal and core is simply crossplatform.</p>
<p>I used an angular template to start the project. As such, there may be some unnecessary files.</p>
<p>I'm unsure if the format of the exported csv files matches the requirements for PIMS. I was unable to find documentation for this, so it simply exports the data in the order of appearance on the Student Fact Template documentation.</p>

<h2>Known issues:</h2>
<p>Validation is not perfect. The form will accept some invalid years but throw an exception when it tries to put it in the database.</p>
<p>It's not completely clear to me yet how exporting to browsers work. The get request kept returning errors, but when I refreshed the page, the file would download as expect. Instead of logging the "error" I just refresh the page and it functions fine.</p>

<h2>Areas of improvement:</h2>
<p>The app could do with more feedback to the user about the state of the submitted form. The validation is done client-side to give validation feedback, but no information is returned about the actual submission to the database.</p>
